# General Contribution Guidelines

Ploink, in addition to it's primary goal as a tool to help you better measure
and understand how contributions are happening in your repositories, also has
the goal of being a gentle introduction project for users who are are curious
about building useful applications in haskell. This secondary goal leads us to a
few guidelines around how contributions should look. If you are an experienced
haskell user, please read through the list below and take these guidelines into
account as you are working on a contribution. If you're new to haskell and some
of these guidelines don't make a lot of sense to you that's okay! If you
accidentally do something outside of these guidelines we'll work with you to fix
up your PR and get it merged.

Note, this list is currently very short, but will grow over time as things
become standards during the development process.

## General Style Guidelines

  - Use `stylish-haskell` to ensure all code is consistently formatted
  - Always use qualified imports
